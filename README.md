# SheepRescue_IS_P2_206059

The tutorial had a flaw when counting the sheeps that fell down, I fixed that using a boolean variable.

Besides all in the tutorials, I have implemented two different features:
  1. Sheep spawn faster as time goes by
  2. Once you get to (a definable number) of saved sheeps, the shooting time interval decreases and you can shoot more bales per second.
